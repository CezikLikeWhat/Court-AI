## About

Court-AI is a project designed to simulate court hearings using AI agents. Each agent represents a different role in the
courtroom, such as the judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, witness, and jury member. The goal is to create a realistic
simulation where agents interact based on pre-defined tasks and scripts.
